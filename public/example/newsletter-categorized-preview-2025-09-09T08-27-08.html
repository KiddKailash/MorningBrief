Apparently, while Meta has been busy drumming up ads proclaiming the privacy of WhatsApp‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚Äútrust us‚Äù like a sitcom cast‚Äîits internal practices have allegedly prioritized user growth over, you know, actual security. Who knew that a company with 3 billion users could have such a <em>cult-like</em> vibe?

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>New Fortress Energy Inc. (NFE): A Rollercoaster Ride of Gains and Losses</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">New Fortress Energy Inc. is not your average energy company. Specializing in natural gas infrastructure, NFE is on a mission to transform energy access across the globe, particularly in the Caribbean and Latin America. However, today, investors are experiencing a <em>not-so-fun</em> rollercoaster ride as the stock plummeted by a staggering <strong>42.86%</strong>. This drop follows a brief spike in share prices, proving that in the world of energy, volatility is the name of the game.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">So, what caused this dramatic shift? Well, it appears that yesterday‚Äôs gains were fueled by the Trump administration's decision to fire five out of seven members of a federal oversight board responsible for Puerto Rico's finances. Investors took this news as a sign to cash in on their profits, leading to a sell-off today. As of 3:40 p.m. ET, NFE shares were down <strong>9.2%</strong> and facing significant downward pressure. This situation highlights the unpredictable nature of the energy sector, where political moves can have immediate and profound impacts on stock prices, especially for companies like New Fortress that are heavily involved in regions with complex financial landscapes. For those keeping tabs on industry trends, it‚Äôs a reminder that energy stocks can be as volatile as the energy they produce, making it essential for investors to stay informed and ready for anything.</p>

<h3>Judge Hits Pause on Anthropic's $1.5 Billion Copyright Settlement</h3>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">In a courtroom drama that rivals any legal thriller, a federal judge has <strong>rejected</strong> Anthropic PBC's proposed $1.5 billion copyright settlement, raising eyebrows and concerns about the deal's integrity. Judge William Alsup, who oversees the case, expressed his <em>unease</em> over potential behind-the-scenes negotiations that could be forcing authors to accept a deal they might not fully understand. It‚Äôs like someone trying to shove a kale smoothie down your throat while insisting it‚Äôs delicious.</p>

<h3>The Details: What‚Äôs at Stake?</h3>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">During the initial hearing since the deal was announced on September 5, Judge Alsup voiced that he feels ‚Äúmisled‚Äù and needs more clarity on how claims will be processed for authors involved. He pointed out that the agreement is ‚Äúnowhere close to complete,‚Äù which is quite the understatement when you consider the whopping $1.5 billion on the table. This isn‚Äôt just Monopoly money; it‚Äôs real cash that could change the lives of many authors, assuming they can actually access it.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">Attorneys for the authors, like Justin Nelson from Susman Godfrey LLP, have assured the court that they‚Äôre committed to ensuring every valid claim is compensated. But with Judge Alsup's concerns lingering, it feels like watching a high-stakes poker game where nobody's really sure what cards everyone is holding. You can read more about this unfolding saga in a detailed report <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/anthropic-judge-blasts-copyright-pact-as-nowhere-close-to-done" target="_blank" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What This Means for Authors and the Industry</h3>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">For authors, this ruling is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they could benefit from a substantial payout; on the other, they might find themselves grappling with a settlement that lacks clarity and fairness. The judge's insistence on thorough scrutiny signals a cautious approach to copyright settlements in an era where AI and creative rights are colliding like two cars at a busy intersection.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">As we watch this legal saga unfold, the implications for the broader creative industry could be profound. If this settlement is ultimately rejected or altered, it may set a precedent for how AI companies negotiate with creators. So, keep your eyes peeled‚Äîthis could be the start of a much larger conversation about the value of creative work in the digital age.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">### AMD's Latest Driver: A Game-Changer for Gamers</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">In a move that has gamers collectively fist-pumping in their basements, AMD has unveiled its latest Software Adrenalin Edition 25.9.1, which now enables <strong>FSR 4</strong> support for over 85 games that previously used FSR 3.1. For those not in the know, FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) is AMD's answer to making your games look better without the need for a second mortgage on your graphics card. With this update, titles like <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Hell Is Us</em> can now bask in the glow of improved visual quality, all thanks to a simple driver update. So, if you thought your graphics were already stunning, think again‚ÄîAMD just cranked the dial to eleven.</p>

<h3>Market Impact and Consumer Behavior</h3>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">This strategic move isn't just about making games prettier; it‚Äôs a calculated play by AMD to keep pace with NVIDIA's DLSS technology. By expanding FSR 4's compatibility, AMD is not only enhancing the gaming experience but also appealing to savvy consumers who are increasingly price-sensitive. Gamers are more likely to choose AMD if they see their existing hardware becoming more powerful without the need for a costly upgrade. As AMD continues to roll out these updates, it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre not just playing catch-up; they‚Äôre redefining the game. For the tech-savvy investor, this could signal a shift in market dynamics as AMD positions itself as a formidable player in the gaming GPU space.

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">Have you heard...</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">Here's everything that didn't make it into this week's newsletters but we immediately sent to the group chat.</p>

<ul style="margin: 5px 0; padding-left: 10px; list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>TMZ</strong> reports that <em>Breaking Bad</em> star <strong>Raymond Cruz</strong> was arrested for allegedly spraying a neighbor with a hose. Guess he took "waterboarding" to a whole new level. </li>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><li><strong>ScienceAlert</strong> warns that the deadly <em>kissing bug</em> disease is on the rise across the U.S. So, if you're planning a romantic evening, maybe skip the outdoor picnic and stick to Netflix. </li></p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><li><strong>Yahoo</strong> tells us that DWTS pro <strong>Jenna Johnson</strong> is feeling <em>anxious</em> to rehearse, but Corey Feldman hasn't shown up yet. Maybe he's too busy practicing his own moves... on the couch?</li></p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><li><strong>PBS</strong> shares that Speaker <strong>Johnson</strong> admits he misspoke about Trump being an FBI informant in the Epstein case. It's always a good day when politicians are just as confused as the rest of us.</li></p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><li><strong>Wccftech</strong> highlights that AMD‚Äôs new driver enables FSR 4 in FSR 3.1 "DX12" games, expanding the list to over 85 titles. That‚Äôs a lot of gaming options for those who need an excuse to avoid adulting!</li></ul></p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Lottery Luck</strong>: A 100% chance of disappointment</p>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;">In an unexpected twist of fate, the Missouri Lottery has revealed the location of the winning ticket, sending the state into a frenzy of excitement and speculation‚Äîif only for a brief moment. However, as the market faces a decline showing NaN%, the real jackpot seems to be a mirage for many. Who knew that purchasing a ticket could lead to such a rollercoaster of emotions, especially when the odds of winning are still stacked against you?</p>

<ul style="margin: 5px 0; padding-left: 10px; list-style-type: disc;"><li>The winning ticket was purchased at a local convenience store, sparking a surge of hopeful visitors looking to cash in on the "luck."</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the stock market's NaN% decline is leaving investors feeling like they've hit the losing end of the lottery. </li>
<li>Analysts are scratching their heads, trying to make sense of the numbers, with many attributing the decline to ongoing economic uncertainties and a lack of consumer confidence.</li>

<p style="margin: 5px 0;"></ul>So, while some are dreaming of riches, others are left to ponder the <em>real</em> lottery: navigating a market that seems to have lost its winning ticket.</p>
