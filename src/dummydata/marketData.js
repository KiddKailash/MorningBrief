            "French biotechnology company Abivax SA (EPA:ABVX) (NASDAQ:ABVX) experienced an extraordinary surge in premarket trading on July 23, 2025, with shares skyrocketing over 400% following the announcement of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for its ulcerative colitis treatment. The company reported compelling results from its ABTECT trials, which evaluated obefazimod, a first-in-class oral miR-124 enhancer, in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. This breakthrough announcement represents a significant milestone for the clinical-stage biotechnology company and offers new hope for patients suffering from this chronic inflammatory bowel disease. ABVX shares opened the premarket session at $49.88, representing a staggering 398.80% increase from the previous close of $10.00. The dramatic surge was triggered by the company’s announcement of successful Phase 3 trial results released after market hours on July 22, 2025. Trading volume spiked significantly as investors reacted to the breakthrough clinical data. The company’s market capitalization jumped to approximately $665 million following the premarket surge, reflecting investor confidence in the commercial potential of obefazimod. With a 52-week range of $4.77 to $13.17 prior to the announcement, the premarket price of nearly $50 represents an extraordinary breakout from previous trading patterns. The stock had been trading with high volatility, as evidenced by its beta of 1.53, making it particularly sensitive to clinical development news. Key financial metrics show the company had preliminary cash and cash equivalents of approximately $71.4 million as of June 30, 2025, providing runway for continued operations and regulatory submissions. The company has postponed its H1 2025 financial results from August 11 to September 8, 2025, likely to focus management attention on the significant clinical milestone. The dramatic stock surge was driven by Abivax’s announcement of positive topline results from both ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 Phase 3 trials, which collectively enrolled 1,275 patients across over 600 clinical sites in 36 countries. The 50mg once-daily dose of obefazimod demonstrated a compelling pooled 16.4% placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate at Week 8, meeting the FDA primary endpoint with high statistical significance (p The trials included a well-balanced population with 47.3% of participants having inadequate response to prior advanced therapies, including the largest population of patients with inadequate response to JAK inhibitor therapy in Phase 3 ulcerative colitis trials to date. This represents a significant addressable market opportunity, as these patients have limited treatment options. The drug also demonstrated favorable tolerability with no new safety signals observed, maintaining consistency with earlier clinical experience. Looking ahead, 678 patients who achieved clinical response have enrolled in the ongoing maintenance trial (ABX464-107), with topline results expected in Q2 2026. Contingent on positive maintenance results, Abivax plans to submit New Drug Applications to both the FDA and European Medicines Agency in the second half of 2026, positioning obefazimod as a potential first-in-class treatment option for ulcerative colitis patients. *** Looking to start your trading day ahead of the curve?Get up to speed before the bell with Bull Whisper—a sharp, daily premarket newsletter packed with key news, market-moving updates, and actionable insights for traders.Start your day with an edge.

Operating income, consisting predominantly of Research Tax Credits and Subsidies, decreased by EUR 0.2M to EUR 1.0M for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to EUR 1.2M for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in operating loss was driven by operating expenses as described further below.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by EUR 3.6M to EUR -39.3M in the first quarter of 2025 compared to EUR -35.7M in the same period in 2024. This increase was predominantly driven by expenses related to: A EUR 3.0M, or 736% increase related to our Crohn’s Disease (CD) clinical program, driven by the progression of Phase 2b clinical trials for obefazimod in CD;A EUR 2.7M, or 78%, increase in transversal activities related to the overall expansion of the R&D headcount to support our organizational growth and the issuance of new equity awards to officers and employees in R&D; andPartially offset by a decrease of EUR 1.3M, or -4%, related to our Ulcerative Colitis (UC) clinical program as our Phase 3 clinical trials reached full enrollment. Sales and marketing (S&M) expenses decreased to EUR -0.9M for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 compared to EUR -2.0M for the same period in 2024. The decrease was predominantly driven by a reduction in non-critical expenses to manage our cash expense.General and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased to EUR -8.0M for the first quarter of 2025 compared to EUR -8.1M for the first quarter of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to: A decrease in personnel costs of EUR 0.6M, resulting from the expense recognition pattern of equity awards granted to certain of our officers and employees, many of which were issued in connection with our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq in October 2023;Offset by EUR 0.4M increase related to legal and professional fees and other costs associated with operating as a dual-listed public company. For the three-months ended March 31, 2025, our EUR -5.2M net financial loss was driven primarily by the following items: Interest expenses of EUR -3.5M in relation to borrowings and loans;Non-cash expense of EUR -1.0M in relation in relation to our royalty certificates; andForeign Exchange losses of EUR -1.0M;Mostly offset by interest income of EUR 0.9M in relation to the invested proceeds from our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq. Cash position as of March 31, 2025 was EUR 103.6M compared to EUR 144.2M as of December 31, 2024. The decrease was due to EUR -33.3M used in operating activities and EUR -7.8M related to principal and interest paid on our debt facilities. This decrease was partially offset by EUR 1.0M of interest received on cash. Based on the currently available funds and operating assumptions, Abivax expects to be able to finance its operating cash flow requirements into the fourth quarter of 2025. ***** About Abivax Abivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.
