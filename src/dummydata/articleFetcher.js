Unsurprisingly, Verge readers had some thoughts.Elon Musk finally admitted that Tesla’s long-promised, more affordable EV is just a stripped-down Model Y. Unsurprisingly, Verge readers had some thoughts.by Andrew J. HawkinsJul 24, 2025, 5:34 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsImage: TeslaAndrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.In an earnings call Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk “let the cat out of the bag”: The new, more affordable electric vehicle the company has been touting for over a year, and that has been singled out as the one thing that could pull Tesla out of its sales rut, wasn’t new at all. It was just the Model Y.Not only that, the stripped-down version of Tesla’s bestselling vehicle is already in development, and will go into volume production in the second half of 2025, the company said in a letter to shareholders. During the call, Musk said it is meant to appeal to customers who want to buy a Tesla, but can’t afford one.“The desire to buy the car is very high, just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it,” he said. “Literally, that is the issue.”“The desire to buy the car is very high, just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it.”The rumor that the affordable EV would just be a bare-bones Model Y has been circulating ever since Musk canceled a previous model that was to be built on an entirely new platform. The so-called “Model 2” was meant to be Musk’s long-promised “$25,o00 EV” that at one point was presented with having a Cybertruck-inspired design. Musk reportedly canceled the new model in favor of building the steering wheel-less Cybercab, which was introduced last year and is expected to go into production in 2026.So now that the rumors have been confirmed and we know that the new EV is just a cheaper Model Y, how will Tesla go about doing that? I could have called up a bunch of experts and done the standard next-day follow, but I didn’t want to go that route. Instead, I went into our comment section, which unsurprisingly had a lot of good ideas. It makes sense that our readers — many of whom are Verge subscribers, love y’all — had some of the best suggestions for how Tesla could strip some of the more premium features out of a vehicle that already feels pretty bare-bones to most. After all, Verge readers are some of the smartest people in the world.“Chris K.” had some good ideas about how to strip some of the more premium features out of the Model Y, like replacing the leather interior with fabric seats, installing mechanical seat adjusters and door latches, plastic hub caps, or removing the interior mood lighting. He also suggested a lower-quality speaker array and cheaper exterior lighting that doesn’t use matrix headlights or light bars. Lastly, he would get rid of the HEPA filter and remove the rear seat display that arrived with the 2024 face-lift of the Model Y.“Readercat2” thought Tesla could take a page from the recently revealed Slate Truck by removing the infotainment screen altogether and just make people use their own phone as the display. This seems incredibly unlikely, as Tesla’s software is fairly central to the ownership experience.Image: Tesla“Hc91” thought Tesla could reduce the number of cameras on the vehicle. That left us wondering how Tesla will square its ambitions to make fully autonomous vehicles with one that is designed to come in at a much lower price point. Could they remove the computer that powers Autopilot and Full Self-Driving? What about external sensors? The Model Y currently sports eight cameras; if Tesla removes some of them, will FSD still work? (Not that it works flawlessly with eight cameras.) The trade-offs could get pretty steep if Tesla starts down that road.The best place to shave costs is the battery, which typically is the most expensive component in an EV. Tesla’s cheapest EVs already utilize low-cost lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistries, nearly all of which are supplied by Chinese battery manufacturers. The company recently started production on its own LFP cells at its factory in Nevada, so it stands to reason that the new, cheaper Model Y is likely to use these batteries.But overwhelmingly our commenters were perplexed by the idea of a stripped-down Model Y, considering many of them already consider the EV to be pretty bare-bones already. “The thing’s going to be literally a skateboard on wheels if he keeps cutting it back,” a commenter called “BeeksElectric” wrote. “I don’t see how he can make any significant price cuts on a product he already has had trouble keeping at the $35,000 base price point he advertised it at in the first place. Couple that with the killing of the EV credit and Tesla could eat it hard if Slate, GM, and VW can actually execute well on the cheap small EVs they have been talking about developing.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew J.

(AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.) Updated [hour]:[minute] [AMPM] [timezone], [monthFull] [day], [year] Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump took to social media Thursday morning to support Elon Musk’s car company, a startling development given their bitter public feud.”I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The post wasn’t enough to help Tesla’s stock, which fell sharply after the company reported another quarter of lackluster financial results and Musk warned of some potentially “rough quarters” into next year. In afternoon trading, the stock was down almost 9%. Late Wednesday, Tesla said revenue fell 12% and profit dropped 16% in the April-June quarter. Many prospective buyers have been turned off by Musk’s foray into right-wing politics, and the competition has ramped up in key markets such as Europe and China.Investors have been unnerved by Musk’s social media spat with the president because Trump has threatened to retaliate by ending government contracts and breaks for Musk’s various businesses, including Tesla. But Trump struck a starkly different tone Thursday morning.“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!” Trump wrote. “The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us.” Related Stories Trump announces trade deal with Japan that lowers threatened tariff to 15% Stephen Colbert gets solidarity from fellow late-night hosts after cancellation news Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%, citing ‘witch hunt’ trial against country’s former president After Trump’s massive budget bill passed earlier this month, Tesla faces the loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit and stands to make much less money from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. Trump’s tariffs on countries including China and Mexico will also cost Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars, the company said on its earnings call. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Musk has blasted the budget bill on his own social media platform X for adding to U.S. debt at a time when it is already too large. The Tesla CEO has called the budget pushed by the president a “disgusting abomination” and has threatened to form a new political party. On Wednesday’s call, Musk said the electric vehicle maker will face “a few rough quarters” as it moves into a future focused less on selling cars and more on offering people rides in self-driving cars. He also talked up the company’s business making humanoid robotics. But he acknowledged those businesses are a ways off from contributing to Tesla’s bottom line. Tesla began a rollout in June of its paid robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and hopes to introduce the driverless cabs in several other cities soon. Musk told analysts that the service will be available to probably “half of the population of the U.S. by the end of the year — that’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”“We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the U.S.,” Musk said, adding that Tesla “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead. He added, though, “Once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling.”",

      "This new attack suddenly soars 5000% in just 2 weeks — what to know.",

      "InnovationCybersecurityIf You See This Message, Your Amazon Account Is Under AttackByZak Doffman, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Zak Doffman writes about security, surveillance and privacy.Follow AuthorJul 24, 2025, 10:14am EDTShareSaveCommentAttacks suddenly surge 5000%.dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images Republished on July 24 with Amazon’s advice to users to combat these attacks. A new warning has just been issued for millions of Amazon users, as a new wave of attacks on accounts has suddenly surged 5000%. This will come at you by text message, which is nothing new. Between undelivered packages, unpaid tolls and motoring fines, the scale of text attacks sweeping the U.S. and Europe is “out of control.” The team at Guardio tells me that these new “Amazon refund scam texts” have surged “more than 50 times in the past two weeks.” Even in the world of text message attacks, that’s some increase. “These texts began appearing shortly after Prime Day, which started two weeks ago on July 8,” and spawned plenty of other attacks as well. The texts are nothing to do with Amazon. The attackers do not even know you have an account. They’re just playing a numbers game because most of you do. “The link in the message leads to a fake Amazon site designed to steal your account details and hack it.” ForbesMicrosoft’s AI Upgrade—A Reason To Stop Using Google Chrome?By Zak Doffman Amazon warns that “scammers may send text messages claiming to be Amazon,” and that account holders should be “mindful” if they “receive a text message for orders or deliveries that you are not expecting.” It’s the same for refunds. MORE FOR YOU Amazon runs an active program to monitor for such impersonation scams, which includes sharing information as and when new campaigns are identified and critically shutting down the bad actors behind these attacks, both technically and legally. But again this is a numbers game. The attackers are running an industrial scale scam that fires out messages indiscriminately. Targets will be found because countless users will have purchased recently on Amazon and who doesn’t want an unexpected refund? The link is a short-code to beat Amazon’s other warning to watch for misspelled URLs. If you receive this text, and many millions of you will. delete it immediately per the advice from the FBI and state and local police forces. If you have any doubts, log into your Amazon account using your app or usual methods and check there. This text attack industry with its billions of messages is driven by organized criminal gangs in China, beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. Networks filter out plenty of texts, but attackers use farms of normal phones and SIMs to bypass normal checks.Fake Amazon texts and login Guardio Trend Micro warns that “30% of consumers have been scammed online, nearly 40% didn’t realize it until they’d already lost money and most didn’t use any tech to verify the scam — relying on instinct alone.” Its new ScamCheck tech is another potential bandaid. In response to Guardio’s warning, Amazon is keen to emphasize the significant effort and investment being put into tackling such impersonation schemes. While this attack is outside its control, the potential viral threat to user accounts is taken seriously. You can read more about Amazon’s defense against impersonation scams here. “In 2024,” it says, “we initiated takedowns of more than 55,000 phishing websites and 12,000 phone numbers being used as part of impersonation schemes.” The company should take some credit for this. This scam text industry is opportunistic and does not target users based on nay prior or relevant data. All that’s needed is a phone number. These are the most basic of scams and yet still they work. If there is any intelligence applied to the scam it’s in the fake websites that capture user login information. Some of these are designed to bypass or capture 2FA codes and they’re often hosted on legitimate infrastructure to trick defensive filters. Clearly these texts are outside Amazon’s control, and so users are urged to report scams as they come in. Users should also ensure their accounts are fully protected, at least by two-factor authentication and ideally by passkeys.ForbesDelete Every Smartphone App On This List—‘70 Million Downloads’By Zak Doffman Amazon is keen to share its key tips to stay safe with those targeted by these attacks.: “Verify purchases on Amazon. If you receive a message about the purchase of a product or service, do not respond to the message or click on any link in the message; instead, log into your Amazon account or use the Amazon mobile app. Trust Amazon’s app and website. We will not ask for payment over the phone or email—only in our mobile app, on our website, or in one of our physical stores. We will not call and ask you to make a payment or bank transfer on another website. Be wary of false urgency. Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency to persuade you to do what they’re asking. Don’t be pressured into buying a gift card. We will never ask you to purchase a gift card, and no legitimate sale or transaction will require you to pay with gift cards. Learn more about common gift card scams on our help pages. Do not call numbers sent over text or email, or found in online search results… Amazon will not ask you to download or install any software to connect with customer service nor will we request payment for any customer service support.” Editorial StandardsReprints & PermissionsLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video",
